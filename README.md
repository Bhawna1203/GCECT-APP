# GCECT-APP
An native android application of Government College of Engineering and Ceramic Technology

## Problem Statement:

Our university website was not properly optimised and responsive for mobile devices which posed difficulties for students to navigate and to utilise all the features the website has to offer.

## Proposed Solution:

This project proposes an university app which has all the features of the university website with some extra added features.
So, now students can install this app and access all the information available in the website. It's basically a subtitute for university website for mobile devices.

Some features that are included in the app are:
<ul>
  <li>recent announcement</li>
  <li>general notice</li>
  <li>download examination schedule</li>
  <li>a note taking section</li>
</ul>
